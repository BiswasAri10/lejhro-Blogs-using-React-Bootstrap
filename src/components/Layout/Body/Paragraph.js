                Without big data analytics, companies are blind and deaf,
                wandering out onto the web like deer on a freeway. ~ Geoffrey
                Moore
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Companies today need every edge and advantage they can get. Thanks
              to obstacles like rapidly changing markets, economic uncertainty,
              finicky consumer attitudes, and even global pandemics, businesses
              today are working with slimmer margins for error.
            </p>
            <p>
              Companies that want to thrive in these competitive markets can
              improve their odds of success with the help of data analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
              This strategy is common sense, and it applies to personal life as
              well as business. No one makes important decisions without first
              finding out what’s at stake, the pros and cons, and the possible
              outcomes. Similarly, no company that wants to succeed should make
              decisions based on bad data. Organisations need information; they
              need data. This is where data analysis enters the picture.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What is data analysis?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Data analysis is defined as a process of cleaning, transforming,
              and modelling data to discover useful information for business
              decision-making. The purpose of Data Analysis is to extract useful
              information from data and take the decision based upon the data
              analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
              The information gathered from the data are then presented visually
              in the form of charts, graphs, or dashboards.
            </p>
            <p>
              The information discovered can help aid the company’s or
              organisation’s growth. Decision-makers will be able to come to an
              actionable conclusion and make the right business decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Types of Data Analysis:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Text Analysis</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Text Analysis is also referred to as Data Mining. It is one of the
              methods of data analysis to discover a pattern in large data sets
              using databases or data mining tools. It used to transform raw
              data into business information.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Descriptive Analysis</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The descriptive analysis method is the starting point to any
              analytic reflection, and it aims to answer the question of what
              happened? It does this by ordering, manipulating, and interpreting
              raw data from various sources to turn it into valuable insights
              for your organisation.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Exploratory Analysis</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              As its name suggests, the main aim of the exploratory analysis is
              to explore. Prior to it, there was still no notion of the
              relationship between the data and the variables. Once the data is
              investigated, the exploratory analysis enables you to find
              connections and generate hypotheses and solutions for specific
              problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Statistical Analysis</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Statistical Analysis shows “What happened?” by using past data in
              the form of dashboards. Statistical Analysis includes collection,
              Analysis, interpretation, presentation, and modelling of data. It
              analyses a set of data or a sample of data.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Predictive analysis</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The predictive method allows you to look into the future to answer
              the question: what will happen? In order to do this, it uses the
              results of the previously mentioned descriptive, exploratory, and
              diagnostic analysis, in addition to machine learning (ML) and
              artificial intelligence (AI). Like this, you can uncover future
              trends, potential problems or inefficiencies, connections, and
              casualties in your data.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Diagnostic Analysis</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Diagnostic Analysis shows “Why did it happen?” by finding the
              cause from the insight found in Statistical Analysis. This
              Analysis is useful to identify behaviour patterns of data. If a
              new problem arrives in your business process, then you can look
              into this Analysis to find similar patterns of that problem. And
              it may have chances to use similar prescriptions for the new
              problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Data Analysis Process</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The Data Analysis Process is gathering information by using a
              proper application or tool which allows you to explore the data
              and find a pattern in it.
            </p>
            <p>It has following phases:</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Identify:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              You first need to identify why you need it in the first place. The
              identification is the stage in which you establish the questions
              you will need to answer. For example, what is the customer's
              perception of our brand? Or what type of packaging is more
              engaging to our potential customers? Once the questions are
              outlined you are ready for the next step.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Collect:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the stage where you start collecting the needed data.
              Here, you define which sources of information you will use and how
              you will use them. The collection of data can come in different
              forms such as internal or external sources, surveys, interviews,
              questionnaires, focus groups, among others.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Cleaning:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Now whatever data is collected may not be useful or irrelevant to
              your aim of Analysis, hence it should be cleaned. The data which
              is collected may contain duplicate records, white spaces or
              errors. The data should be cleaned and error free. This phase must
              be done before Analysis because based on data cleaning, your
              output of Analysis will be closer to your expected outcome.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Analysis:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the data is collected, cleaned, and processed, it is ready
              for Analysis. As you manipulate data, you may find you have the
              exact information you need, or you might need to collect more
              data. During this phase, you can use data analysis tools and
              software which will help you to understand, interpret, and derive
              conclusions based on the requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Interpretation:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              After analysing your data, it’s finally time to interpret your
              results. You can choose the way to express or communicate your
              data analysis either you can use simply in words or maybe a table
              or chart.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Visualisation:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Data visualisation is very common in your day to day life; they
              often appear in the form of charts and graphs. In other words,
              data shown graphically so that it will be easier for the human
              brain to understand and process it.
